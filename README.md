# 🗣️ AI Voice Bot – XYZ Customer Support  

## 🌟 What is this?  
This is an **AI-powered voice bot** that helps **XYZ's e-commerce customers** with common support tasks like:  
✅ Tracking their orders (e.g., "Where is my order?")  
✅ Canceling orders (if possible)  
✅ Answering questions about payments, discounts, and returns  
✅ Connecting them to a customer support agent if needed  
✅ Exiting naturally when a user says "Thank you" or "Bye"  

It's like **a virtual assistant** that listens, understands, and responds **like a human!** 🤖🗣️

## 🛠️ How Does It Work?  
1️⃣ The bot **greets the user** and listens for their question.  
2️⃣ It **figures out what they need** (tracking, cancellation, payment info, etc.).  
3️⃣ If an **order number is mentioned,** it **checks the database** and gives an update.  
4️⃣ The bot **answers the user’s question** based on what it understood.  
5️⃣ If the bot **can’t understand,** it **asks for clarification or lets the user type instead.**  
6️⃣ If the user asks for an agent, it **immediately transfers them** (without extra steps!).  
7️⃣ When the user says **"Thank you" or "Bye,"** the bot **ends the conversation gracefully.**
